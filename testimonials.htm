        <p><em>Dear Kasey</em>,<br>
          I can't thank you enough for taking away any reason for worry when we had to leave Zoe with you. My husband and I had a great vacation, and we both appreciated your occasional text on how Zoe was doing. I even saw a photo of you and Zoe on your Facebook page. You've made loyal friends out of Zoe and me. Thank you again.<br>

          I'm writing on behalf of my owner, Ronnie. He hasn't stopped raving about what a great time I've had at the plush &quot;Fritz Ritz&quot;. If only he knew how much running around I made you do, he might woeey that maybe I wouldn't be allowed back. But, it looked as if you had as much fun as I did. See you soon!<br>

          I was nervous about boarding Mister Wilsn at Pampered Pups. He is very reserved and particular about his surroundings. However, I was relived at how attentive Carmella was with him. Mister Wilson let his guard down and soon began to act like a &quot;pampered pup&quot;. Your company slogan really say it all.<br>

        Angie wanted me to write and let you know how great she feels. Her hair is so smooth, and I no longer hear her toes scratching across my kitchen floor. Shane, you have such a way with animals. Angie is usually hyper and jumpy, but your calm manner made her grooming visit unlike any other. Thanks for a wonderful first visit. We are alresy looking forward to next month.<br>

      <p><em>Dear Dee</em>,<br>
        Thank you so much for keeping Patch safe and happe while I was away on business last week. I know he was happy to see me, but I could tell he had a great time at the &quot;Fritz Ritz&quot;. I appreciate all that you and your employees did to make Patch's stay so memorable.<br>
