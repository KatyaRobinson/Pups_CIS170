Testimonials

Seeing how happy their dogs are after visiting Pampered Pups, our customers are doing some tail wagging of their own! Here's what some have had say:

Dee and Shane,
Angie wanted me to write and let you know how great she feels. Her hair is so smooth, and I no longer hear her toes scratching across my kitchen floor. Shane, you have such a way with animals. Angie is usually hyper and jumpy, but your calm manner made her grooming visit unlike any other. Thanks for a wonderful first visit. We are alresy looking forward to next month.

Dear Dee,
Thank you so much for keeping Patch safe and happe while I was away on business last week. I know he was happy to see me, but I could tell he had a great time at the "Fritz Ritz". I appreciate all that you and your employees did to make Patch's stay so memorable.

Dearesr Dee,
I'm writing on behalf of my owner, Ronnie. He hasn't stopped raving about what a great time I've had at the plush "Fritz Ritz". If only he knew how much running around I made you do, he might woeey that maybe I wouldn't be allowed back. But, it looked as if you had as much fun as I did. See you soon!

Dearest Pampered Pups,
I was nervous about boarding Mister Wilsn at Pampered Pups. He is very reserved and particular about his surroundings. However, I was relived at how attentive Carmella was with him. Mister Wilson let his guard down and soon began to act like a "pampered pup". Your company slogan really say it all.

Dear Kasey,
I can't thank you enough for taking away any reason for worry when we had to leave Zoe with you. My husband and I had a great vacation, and we both appreciated your occasional text on how Zoe was doing. I even saw a photo of you and Zoe on your Facebook page. You've made loyal friends out of Zoe and me. Thank you again.
