      <div id="article">Every since I was a kid, dogs have been some of my best friends. I grew up helping my aunt Maria in her dog grooming salon, The Clip-n-Fluff. It was only natural that this love for pets would develop into my life's work. After college, I managed a local veterinary clinic for six years, until 2003, when my aunt was gettin ready to retire and wanted me to take over ger business. I saw the need for a place where dogs of every bred and size could pley and get some TLC while their families were at work or out of town.  Ans so, that year, Pampered Pups was born. We've been pampering dogs ever since, and they haven't stopped waggling their tails!<br>
        Pampered Pups is just as opular with owners as it is with their pets. Our services and hours are tailored to meet the needs of busy pet owners who want their &quot;best friends&quot; treated with the affection and care they get at home. Come see for yourself! Stop in for a visit, and bring your dog along with you.<br>
